# [DropAt](https://apps.apple.com/app/dropat/id6749478138)

**DropAt** is a location-based social messaging iOS app where users can leave geotagged messages‚Äîcalled "drops"‚Äîat real-world locations. Others can view nearby drops on a map, but must physically visit the original location to unlock and read the full message.

This project was fully conceptualized, designed, developed, and deployed to the App Store as a solo developer effort. It is not open-source and is shared here solely for portfolio and demonstration purposes.
